            <h3 class="AshColor">Web Innovation Techniques</h3>
            <p>Innovation is a creative, dynamic process that can't be fully encapsulated in a series of how-to steps. Instead,
            innovation is a repertoire of skills in creatively monitoring and understanding user needs and developing web structures
            to meet those needs.</p>
            <p>Because the World Wide Web is dynamic, highly enmeshed, competitive, and often a continuously available, global service,
            developing a web never stops. The information space in which a web operates constantly changes, and, possibly, the
            domain information of a web changes. The amount that a web changes depends on users' needs, the nature of the domain
            information, and other factors such as the growth of competitive webs. The key to approaching this need for continuous
            development is to keep all web-development processes operating. After plans are made for a web, those plans should be
            reevaluated and adjusted to new conditions. People working on the planning, analysis, design, implementation, and
            promotion of a web need to communicate with each other, work together to accomplish many tasks, and continuously strive
            to improve the web for the good of the user.</p>

            <h3 class="AshColor ">Become a Web developer</h3>
            <p>Web innovators should seek to creatively meet and exceed user expectations and needs by improving the web's value,
            accuracy, currency, competitiveness, and user interest. Increasing these aspects of a web is a multiprocess effort: the
            techniques described here blend with and borrow from the other processes of web development.</p>

            <p>Quality is a difficult term to define specifically for a particular domain or product. Total Quality Management, derived
            from W. Edwards Deming's principles, includes ideas such as continuous, measurable improvement and multidisciplinary
            responsibility for improving a product. Information quality has much in common with product quality. Like a physical
            product, information should meet user needs (satisfy the customer). Meeting this principle in specific
            information-development practices and web-design features, however, is not so straightforward; the type of needs a user
            has varies greatly from application to application. A general statement for web information quality can be made,
            however.</p>
